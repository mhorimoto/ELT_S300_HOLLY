# ELT SENSOR S-300 Series CO2 sensor

![ELT S-300](http://eltsensor.co.kr/2016/jp/images/sub/prod/oem_modules/co2-smallest-sensors-module.jpg)

This is a library for the S-300 series CO2 sensor.

- http://eltsensor.co.kr/2016/jp/products/oem_modules/S-300.html

These sensors use **I2C** to communicatge, 2pins are required to interface.

**CAUTION!**  
**This library is personally created independently of ELT, and ELT has nothing to do with defects in this library.**

## Installation

Use the Arduino Library Manager to install this library. If you're unfamiliar
with how this works, we have a great tutorial on Arduino library installation

(In Japanese)

## ToDo

 - Although this library has functions such as MCDL as methods of this library, it is not reflected in the sample program, so it is necessary to create a sample program to introduce them.

 - It is necessary to enhance the functional description for hardware reset.
